## About The Project
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In normal education, we group children into different sections using some broad boundaries like age, gender, IQ level etc for efficient education plan preparation. While it can be justified in terms of practicality, it is proven that they need to be treated individually wherever possible for better results. <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of special education,  each child must be treated specially and he/she must have his/her own education plan. Creating and managing educational plans for each individual is found to be a tedious task, so we look for some software solutions that could do the task. Unfortunately, we couldn't find one that meets our expectations and available solutions were either proprietary or in a dead development state. <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So with the support from ICFOSS, we build an IEP software called SPIN IEP using most modern web technologies & frameworks. It is currently used around 5 special schools other than INSIGHT and responses were extremely positive.
